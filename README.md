**PROBLEM APPROACH:**
1. As the task was to built "Personal Expense Traker", so in it I have developed features one by one
   Add Expences
   View Expences
   Search Expences
   Total Expences
   Highest Expence

2. So I used a approach and built every feature one by one. and at the end everything was built.

**CHALLANGES**
1. First challenge I faced in building this feature is to use built in functions like expend, and methods for current date etc.
2. Second issue which I faced was related to lambda logic.
3. Thired challange which I faced was with the syntex, as its easy compared to other languages but not having open and closed bracktes were difficult for me.

**KEY TAKAWAYS**
1. I have learned alot of things like built-in functions of python.
2. When we import classes from modules of date and time.
3. Code position does not matter in python, like functions can be written before main menu, python will execute menu first.
